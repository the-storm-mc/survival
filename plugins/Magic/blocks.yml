# Modify this file to add or remove magic block templates.
#
# A "magic block" is a virtual block that can cast spells, spawn mobs or show effects.
# Each blokc in-game inherits from one of the configured templates in this file,
# but can be customized in-game.
#
# You can add new templates in this file or modify the builtin ones. Use load_default_blocks: false
# in config.yml to remove the default templates completely.
#
# You can also add individual files to the blocks/ folder
#
# To see the current default builtin configs, look in this folder:
# https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/tree/master/Magic/src/main/resources/examples/survival/blocks
#
# For customization help see:
