#Placeholders: %PLAYER% is the name of the hacker, %PLAYERUUID% is the UUID of the player, %HACKNAME% is the likely name of the hack.
#%CHECKNAME% is the check that detected the player for hacking (this can sometimes be the same as HACKNAME but can be different too).

#Welcome to AntiAura's configuration!
